[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

Can run right from command line with python like `python advent_of_code.py <day>` or build through docker like

```
docker build --tag advent-of-code .
docker run -e day=<day> advent-of-code
```

If running with python, you will need at least version 3.10 since pattern matching is used.
