# Python

Can run right from command line with python like `python advent_of_code.py <day>` while in `python` directory or build through docker like

```
docker build --tag advent-of-code -f Dockerfile.python .
docker run -e day=<day> advent-of-code
```

If running with python, you will need at least version 3.10 since pattern matching is used.

# Rust

coming later
